# Groups are nice for organization, but thatâ€™s not all groups are good for. 
# You can also assign variables to them! For instance, atlanta has its own NTP servers, so when setting up ntp.conf, we should use them.

# file: group_vars/rj
#ntp: ntp-atlanta.example.com
#backup: backup-atlanta.example.com
